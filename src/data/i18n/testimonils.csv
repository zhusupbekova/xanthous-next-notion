testimonials.amzkungfu.testimonialContent,"Simon and his team at Xanthous Tech have raised the bar for a development firm. They consistently deliver incredible results and at lightning speeds. They're also a joy to work with. Unlike other development firms, you have complete transparency into their process, and can see every code commit and track every minute. They have deep experience with Serverless framework, React, Next.JS, GatsbyJS, APIs and Modern DevOps that I haven't found anywhere else. I've almost wanted to keep them a secret because they're that good. You can stop looking for developers, Xanthous is the best you'll find anywhere.","西蒙和他在Xanthous Tech的团队提高了一家开发公司的门槛。 它们始终以闪电般的速度提供令人难以置信的结果。 与他们一起工作也很快乐。 与其他开发公司不同，您可以完全透明地了解其过程，并且可以每分钟查看和提交每个代码。 他们对无服务器框架，React，Next.JS，GatsbyJS，API和Modern DevOps具有深厚的经验，而我在其他地方都找不到。 我几乎想保守他们的秘密，因为他们是如此的好。 您可以停止寻找开发人员，Xanthous是您在任何地方都能找到的最好的。"
